# Image Classification
Medical image recognition and classification is one of the most important problems in the image recognition area these days. Its goal is to classify medical images into different categories to help doctors in disease diagnosis or further research. Accurately identified decease patterns on earlier stages can save lives. In the past, doctors used their professional expertise to classify the medical images. This is a difficult, tedious, and time-consuming task. Also, such approach is prone to instability and human error. In the last decades medical image classification research has gained a lot of momentum and progressed significantly. In this project, I am comparing several classification techniques including traditional ML methods, such as SVM and KNN, and an open-source pre-trained Neural Network model.

### Data
There are 1,583 normal and 4,273 pneumonia x-ray images of different sizes in the dataset. 
The data is sourced from Mendeley Data (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2)[1].


### Objective
Find an appropriate classification model that classifies images with high accuracy and recall.
